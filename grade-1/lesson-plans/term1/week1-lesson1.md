# Grade 1 - Term 1, Week 1, Lesson 1

## Lesson Overview
Focus: Introduction to Basic Movement Patterns

### Curriculum Outcomes Targeted
1. Apply locomotor skills when playing cooperative games and activities (DOING)
2. Investigate spatial and body awareness, including effort and relationships (KNOWING)
3. Apply safe practices, rules, and procedures (VALUING)

### Specific Learning Outcomes
1. Demonstrate basic locomotor movements
   - Walk in different directions
   - Change speeds safely
   - Follow simple pathways
2. Show awareness of personal space
   - Maintain safe distances
   - Recognize boundaries
   - Respond to stop signals
3. Follow movement instructions
   - Understand basic commands
   - React to movement cues
   - Demonstrate body awareness

## Lesson Structure

### 1. Warm-Up (5-7 minutes)
**Activity: Moving Exploration**
- Walk in personal space
- Follow movement commands
- Body part identification

**Links to Outcomes:**
- Apply locomotor skills (Outcome 1)
- Show spatial awareness (Outcome 2)

### 2. Skill Development (15-20 minutes)
**Activity 1: Walking Patterns**
- Different directions
- Speed variations
- Pathway following

**Links to Outcomes:**
- Demonstrate locomotor movements (Outcome 1)
- Apply safe practices (Outcome 3)

**Activity 2: Space Bubble Game**
- Personal space practice
- Movement freezes
- Direction changes

**Links to Outcomes:**
- Investigate spatial awareness (Outcome 2)
- Apply safe practices (Outcome 3)

## Assessment Plan

### Observation (KNOWING)
Objective: Assess spatial awareness and basic locomotor skills
- Movement control checklist
- Space awareness tracking
- Safety practice notes

Example Checklist Items:
- Maintains personal space while moving
- Changes direction without colliding
- Responds promptly to stop signals

### Conversation (DOING)
Objective: Evaluate understanding of movement concepts
- Individual check-ins during activity
- Group discussion about space
- Safety understanding questions

Sample Questions:
- "How do you know if you're in someone's space?"
- "What helps you move safely?"
- "Why do we need to watch where we're going?"

### Products (VALUING)
Objective: Document movement skill application
- Movement pattern demonstrations
- Space awareness demonstrations
- Safety rule applications

Evidence Collection:
- Photo/video documentation (if permitted)
- Skill demonstration checklist
- Safety behavior tracking

## Assessment Tools

### Movement Skills Rubric
| Level | Locomotor Control | Space Awareness | Safety Practice |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 4 | Consistent control, smooth transitions | Always maintains space, anticipates others | Models safe behavior, helps others |
| 3 | Good control, basic transitions | Usually maintains space, adjusts when needed | Follows safety rules consistently |
| 2 | Developing control, some instability | Sometimes enters others' space, needs reminders | Follows rules with reminders |
| 1 | Limited control, frequent support needed | Often enters others' space, many reminders needed | Requires constant safety reminders |

## Equipment and Resources
- Floor spots
- Music system
- Boundary markers
- Assessment clipboard
- Movement pattern cards

## Modifications/Adaptations
- Space: Adjust activity area size
- Time: Modify activity duration
- Equipment: Use visual markers
- Support: Provide peer helpers

## Safety Considerations
- Clear movement space
- Personal space awareness
- Safe stopping signals
- Emergency procedures review

## Notes
- Adapt activities based on class size
- Monitor student engagement
- Note individual needs
- Document assessment observations
